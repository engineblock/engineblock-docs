      <description>Synopsis When coordinating activities with each other, it is necessary to link the completion status of an activity to the inputs available to another. Doing this concurrently and efficiently presents some interesting challenges.
Some testing scenarios require that you are able to take the results of one phase of testing as input to another phase. For example, you may want to simply visit created data in a later phase to verify that it is accurate.</description>

      <description>Histogram-based analysis is one of the most effective methods for performance characterization. However, there is not enough flexibility in how the existing tools work to support the scripting needs in EngineBlock. This document outlines the problems with the existing tool in the context of advanced scripting and a design for how to collect and use histogram data effectively.
The Accuracy Challenge When making analysis decisions from histogram data, you need full delta snapshots between measurement times.</description>
