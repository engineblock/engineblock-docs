			<h1>Activity Internals </h1>

			

<p>Activities are a generalization of some type of client work that needs to occur
to generate work against a test target. However, a purely abstract interface for
activities would be so open-ended that it would provide no common scaffolding.
On the contrary, we do want some sense of isomorphism between activity types in
terms of how they are implemented and reasoned about. After reading this
document, you should know what it means to implement an activity properly&ndash;
building on the core machinery while adding in activity-type behavior
appropriately. That is what an Activity Type is for &ndash; filling in the difference
between what the core machinery provides and what is needed to simulate a
particular kind of application workload.</p>

<h2 id="activitytypes">ActivityTypes</h2>

<p>Each activity that runs in EngineBlock is provided by an instance of an
ActivityType. The first activity type that you will become familiar with is
called <code>diag</code>. An ActivityType is responsible for providing the
application-like functionality that can be used in template form by activity
instances. When you are ready, there is a section all about the basics of
actually <a href="http://docs.engineblock.io/dev-guide/building_activities/">implementing an activity
type</a>.</p>

<h2 id="activity-parameters">Activity Parameters</h2>

<p>All activities are controlled at runtime with a <em>ParameterMap</em>. This is simply
an observable thread-safe map of configuration values in string-string form,
with type-specific getters. It also provides basic parsing and type checking for
common parameters.</p>

<p>On the command line, you can specify parameters for an activity in the form:</p>

<pre><code>type=cql alias=activity1 yaml=inserts_cql.yaml cycles=0..1000 threads=10
</code></pre>

<p>Other convenient forms are available when needed &ndash; a JSON map for example.</p>

<h2 id="threading">Threading</h2>

<p>At runtime, an activity is driven by a dedicated thread pool harness &ndash; the
ActivityExecutor. This harness knows how to adjust the running threads down or
up, as needed by changes to the related <em>threads</em> parameter. This is meaningful
for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The client behavior can emulate typical threading dynamics of real
applications more accurately than a task-and-queue-only abstraction.</li>
<li>The synthetic thread ID can be borrowed and used to directly
map some measure of concurrency of data flow.</li>
<li>It is a familiar concurrency primitive that is used in many other testing tools.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a few lifetime scopes to keep in mind when a scenario is running. They
are:</p>

<pre><code>  scenario (control script)
    activity
      motor thread
      motor thread
      ...
    activity
      motor thread
      ...
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>These scopes nest strictly from outside to inside. Activity-specific threads,
labeled <code>motor threads</code> above, run within the activity. Their executors run in
their own thread per-activity, and so forth. The term <code>motor thread</code> is used
here, but when working with EngineBlock you can generally think of them
interchangeably, as all <strong>Runnable</strong> threads within a running activity are
implemented via the Motor API. It is the Motor and other interfaces which allows
the EngineBlock runtime to easily drive the workloads for an activity in a
modular way.</p>

<p>The ActivityType interface, part of the core EngineBlock API, allows you to
control how threads are created for activity instances, and how activity
instances are created for an activity. This means that the API has two levels of
instantiation and initialization, so some care has been taken to keep it as
simple as possible, nonetheless. Here are the scoping layers above with some
additional detail:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Scenario has ActivityType instances.

<ul>
<li>An ActivityType can create:</li>
<li>Activity instances</li>
<li>MotorDispenser instances</li>
<li>InputDispenser instances</li>
<li>ActionDispenser instances</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>When an activity is initialized, it is created from the ActivityType. As well, a
dispenser for the three other types above is created from the ActivityType and
these are installed into the activity.</p>

<p>From this point forward, when a new thread needs to be created for an activity,
the <strong>Runnable</strong> is dispensed by the MotorDispenser on that activity. The Input
and Action instances for that thread are also dispensed from the InputDispenser
and ActionDispenser on that activity, respectively.</p>

<p>In practice, you don&rsquo;t have to think about the API at this level of detail. Most
new ActivityType implementations will simply implement the API just enough to
provide an Action implementation and nothing more.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.engineblock.io/dev-guide/annotated_diag/">annotated Diag</a> section shows the diag activity
type, built one piece at a time.</p>

<h3 id="why-motors">Why Motors?</h3>

<p>Each ActivityExecutor uses the <em>Motor</em> API to manage activity threads. A Motor
is nothing new. The reason for the Motor abstraction to exists is to provide a
more definite boundary between the machinery and the pluggable workloads. It
provides a control boundary that is tangible to both the scripting runtime and
the new concurrent programmer. For this reason, seasoned Java programmers will
find nothing new or novel in the Motor abstraction. It&rsquo;s simply there to do the
obvious things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable (desired and actual) state signaling between executor and thread.</li>
<li>Represent the per-thread flow and execution of inputs and actions.</li>
<li>Instrument said inputs and actions for metrics.</li>
<li>Control the per-thread unit of work around longer-running, tighter iterations</li>
</ol>

<p>Motors lifetimes are not per-cycle. Motors can hang around in an activity
executor, be stopped, started, etc. They keep the same input and action
assignments that they were assembled with initially. You can think of motors as
event pumps which are meant to keep running while there is data available. They
aren&rsquo;t meant to cycle once for a lightweight task.</p>

<p>While it is possible to implement your own Motors, this will almost never be necessary.</p>

<h3 id="slots-aka-threads">Slots, AKA Threads</h3>

<p>To support multiple signal routing topologies within an activity, the concept of
a slot is used. A slot is nothing more than an indexed position for a thread in
a thread pool.</p>

<p>When a thread is being started for an activity, a motor instance is created for
the slot, as well as an input and action instance. However, the ActivityType
implementation has control of how these are created. If the ActivityType
implementation chooses, it may return a unique input for each slot, or a single
cached instance for all slots. This is controlled simply by the slot index,
which is passed into the factory methods for motors, inputs and threads.</p>

<h2 id="activity-alias">Activity Alias</h2>

<p>The only way to address a running activity for dynamic control is through its
<em>alias</em>. An alias is simply the name that the ScenarioController knows as the
activity&rsquo;s name at runtime. If an alias is not provided, the runtime may accept
a new activity, but it will be forced to generate an internal name for it.</p>

<h2 id="activitytype-name">ActivityType Name</h2>

<p>ActivityTypes are discovered by the runtime via the Java ServiceLoader API. In
addition to the basic Java type, an ActivityType instance has a name. For the
built-in diagnostic activity type, it is &lsquo;diag&rsquo;. Each activity type name must be
unique at runtime, or an error is thrown.</p>

<p>With an activity alias and the activity type name, you have enough information
to tell EngineBlock how to start an activity. The variable names for these are
<strong>alias</strong> and <strong>type</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="iterating-a-cycle">Iterating a Cycle</h2>

<p>While an activity is running, each of its slots has a running motor which does
the following continuously.</p>

<ol>
<li>Verify Motor control state, stop if signalled (a stop was requested)</li>
<li>Read the next input value (a long) from the Input, stop if exhausted</li>
<li>Apply the value to the Action.</li>
</ol>

<p>The motor acts as a data pump, pulling in new test values to the application
workload and turning the crank on the workload machinery. The consumer interface
for an Action is very basic. This is intentional, and allows the maximum amount
of flexibility in workload (AKA ActivityType) design. The motor control state is
simply an atomically-visible breaker that is controlled by the ActivityExecutor.</p>

<p>The default implementation of an activity input is a sequence generator. This is
what most activities will need. However, rate controls and other decorators may
be desired, so the API makes it easy to wrap the default input.</p>

<h2 id="activitytype-discovery">ActivityType Discovery</h2>

<p><em>ActivityType</em> implementations are discovered by the runtime using the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">ServiceLoader API</a> ,
with the service name <strong>io.engineblock.activityapi.ActivityType.</strong> That means
simply that you must add the fully-qualified class name of your ActivityType
implementations to the META-INF/services/io.engineblock.activityapi.ActivityType
file of your built jar. A maven plugin automates this during build, and is
explained in further detail in the dev guides.</p>
