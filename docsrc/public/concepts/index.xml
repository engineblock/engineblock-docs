      <description>EngineBlock (EB) is a machine pattern for load test design and execution. This guide is intended to illustrate the moving parts and how they work together.
Scenario EngineBlock executes performance testing scenarios in a Nashorn scripting environment. The scenario is in the form of a script, either constructed on-the-fly from the command line options, or directly created by a scenario designer.
Activity A scenario can have multiple activities. Each activity runs independently of the others, and independently of the control flow of the scenario script.</description>
