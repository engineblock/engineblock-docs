      <description>EngineBlock (EB) is a machine pattern for load test design and execution. This guide is intended to illustrate the moving parts and how they work together.
Scenario EngineBlock executes performance testing scenarios in a Nashorn scripting environment. The scenario is in the form of a script, either constructed on-the-fly from the command line options, or directly created by a scenario designer.
Activity A scenario can have multiple activities. Each activity runs independently of the others, and independently of the control flow of the scenario script.</description>

      <description>Status This is in active development. Collaborators are welcome. However, there is still work to be done to groom the slope for new users.
Engine Block This project aims to provide a missing power tool in the test tooling arsenal.
The design goals:
 Provide a useful and intuitive Reusable Machine Pattern for constructing and reasoning about concurrent performance tests. To encourage this, the runtime machinery is based on simple and tangible core concepts.</description>

      <description>Getting EngineBlock The latest release can always be run with this simple script: run-eb. You can use the commands below to get it.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engineblock/engineblock/master/eb-cli/bin/run-eb chmod u+x run-eb ./run-eb help  This script demonstrates how to fetch the version of the latest published artifact via maven central search. It also downloads that artifact if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t find it locally cached within the last 2 days.
A cautionary word: As always, blindly running scripts from the web is not a good idea.</description>
